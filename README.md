## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
  - I used the Visual Studio Code extension Live Sass Compiler by Glenn Marks to compile my SCSS to CSS.

### What I learned

I learned structuring your HTML with the BEM methodology makes it more readable.

### Continued development

I want to continue using the BEM methodology in future projects.

## Acknowledgments

I started doing this project following along with Kevin Powell's Youtube tutorial at first. I decided to challenge myself by doing this project with SCSS and using the BEM methodology.
